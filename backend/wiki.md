# Project Alpha

## Overview

Project Alpha is a project employing a microservices architecture with the initial intention of using MongoDB as its primary data storage solution. The project faced challenges related to database performance and budget constraints in its early stages. This article summarizes the key events, decisions, and challenges encountered during the project's initial phase based on available documentation.

## Timeline

*   **2024-01-15:** Project Alpha Kickoff, initiating the project with a microservices architecture and MongoDB as the primary database.
*   **2024-02-10:** Security Policy Update, mandating OAuth 2.0 authentication, encrypted data at rest, and regular security audits.
*   **2024-03-20:** Architecture Review in March identified significant performance bottlenecks with the MongoDB setup.
*   **2024-04-05:** Q1 Retrospective, highlighting the success of the microservices architecture, strong team collaboration, and on-track security implementation, while also noting database challenges.
*   **2024-05-12:** Emergency Budget Meeting, resulting in a budget reduction from $50,000 to $30,000.

## Key Decisions

*   **Database Selection:** Initially, MongoDB was chosen as the primary data storage solution.
*   **Security Implementation:** The team committed to implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication, encrypted data at rest, and regular security audits.
*   **Budget Adjustment:** The project budget was reduced from $50,000 to $30,000 due to changing market conditions.

## Contradictions & Changes

*   **MongoDB vs. Potential Alternative:** The initial plan involved using MongoDB. However, the Architecture Review in March revealed significant performance issues with MongoDB, suggesting a possible contradiction and potential need for a change in database technology. While the documentation doesn't explicitly state a *change* to another database, the performance issues strongly imply a deviation from the original MongoDB plan.

## Obsolete Information

*   The initial budget outlined in the "Project Alpha - Kickoff" document (2024-01-15) is obsolete due to the budget reduction announced in the "Emergency Budget Meeting" document (2024-05-12).

## Current Status

Based on the available documentation, Project Alpha is facing challenges related to database performance and a reduced budget. The microservices architecture and security implementation are progressing well. The budget reduction is impacting future plans, specifically delaying infrastructure migration. A database reevaluation is likely occurring due to the performance issues identified with MongoDB.
