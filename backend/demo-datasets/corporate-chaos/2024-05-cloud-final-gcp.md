## Technical Architecture
- **Compute:** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for all workloads
- **Database:** Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for relational data
- **Storage:** Cloud Storage for object storage
- **Analytics:** BigQuery for data warehousing and analytics
- **AI/ML:** Vertex AI for machine learning pipelines

## Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Development and staging environments (June-July 2024)
- **Phase 2:** Non-critical production workloads (August-September 2024)
- **Phase 3:** Critical production systems (October-December 2024)
- **Validation:** Parallel running with Azure during transition

## Team Impact
- **Training:** Mandatory GCP certification for all engineers
- **Consultants:** Engaging Google Cloud Professional Services
- **Documentation:** Complete runbook overhaul for GCP
- **Support:** 24/7 Google Cloud enterprise support contract

## Lessons Learned
This third migration reflects our maturation in cloud strategy evaluation. We have now conducted proper TCO analysis, performance benchmarking, and multi-year cost projections.

**This is our final cloud platform decision.**
