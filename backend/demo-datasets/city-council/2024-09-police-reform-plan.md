**Department:** Police Department & Community Safety
**Author:** Police Chief Angela Martinez & Community Safety Task Force

## Reimagining Public Safety in Athens

Comprehensive reform to build trust, improve outcomes, and create genuine community safety.

## Reform Principles
- **Community-First:** Safety created with communities, not imposed on them
- **Accountability:** Transparent policies and consequences for misconduct
- **De-escalation:** Mental health crisis response without armed police
- **Prevention:** Invest in root causes (housing, mental health, jobs)
- **Equity:** Address disparate impacts on communities of color

## Structural Changes

### Alternative Response Programs
- **HEART Team:** Mental health professionals respond to mental health calls (not police)
- **Community Responders:** Unarmed responders for non-violent calls
- **Homeless Outreach:** Social workers for homelessness-related calls
- **Youth Services:** Youth specialists (not police) for truancy and minor issues
- **Target:** 40% of current police calls redirected to specialists

### Use of Force Reforms
- **Duty to Intervene:** Officers must stop excessive force by colleagues
- **De-escalation Required:** De-escalation attempts mandatory before force
- **Force Continuum:** Strict limits on force escalation
- **Ban Chokeholds:** Prohibited in all circumstances
- **Shooting at Vehicles:** Banned except imminent threat to life
- **Warning Shots:** Prohibited
- **Exhaust Options:** Officers must exhaust all alternatives before deadly force

### Accountability Systems
- **Civilian Review Board:** Independent board investigates complaints (binding authority)
- **Body Cameras:** Mandatory activation for all police interactions
- **Early Warning System:** Track officers with patterns of complaints
- **Discipline Matrix:** Transparent, consistent consequences for violations
- **Decertification:** Officers with serious violations lose police certification

### Community Policing
- **Beat Officers:** Officers assigned to neighborhoods (not rotating)
- **Community Meetings:** Monthly community conversations in each neighborhood
- **Youth Programs:** Officers mentor and support youth programs
- **Business Partnerships:** Collaboration with local businesses
- **Problem-Solving:** Address root causes, not just symptoms

## Budget Reallocation
- **Police Budget:** Reduce by 15% ($8M)
- **Alternative Response:** $4M for HEART team and community responders
- **Mental Health Services:** $2M for crisis intervention services
- **Youth Programs:** $1M for after-school and job programs
- **Affordable Housing:** $1M for housing-first homelessness program

## Training Requirements
- **De-escalation:** 40 hours annual training (up from 8 hours)
- **Implicit Bias:** Mandatory annual training
- **Mental Health First Aid:** All officers certified
- **Cultural Competency:** Understanding diverse communities
- **Trauma-Informed:** Recognize and respond to trauma

## Transparency & Data
- **Public Dashboard:** Real-time data on stops, arrests, use of force
- **Demographic Data:** Track disparate impacts by race
- **Complaint Data:** Public access to complaint investigations
- **Body Camera Footage:** Timely release to public in critical incidents
- **Annual Report:** Comprehensive public safety data and analysis

## Community Investment
Safety is created through:
- Affordable housing
- Quality education
- Living-wage jobs
- Mental health services
- Youth development programs
- Strong community ties

## Opposition Expected
Some fear reduced police budgets, but evidence shows:
- Over-policing harms communities
- Alternative responses more effective for many calls
- Prevention more effective than punishment
- Community trust improves actual safety

Athens chooses a new path toward true community safety.
