# Budget Reallocation: Climate Program Adjustments
**Date:** 2024-05-20
**Department:** City Manager's Office
**Author:** City Manager Robert Thompson

## Fiscal Responsibility: Climate Program Modifications

Due to budget constraints and competing priorities, Athens must **scale back climate initiatives** and refocus on core services.

## Budget Reductions
- **Climate Budget:** Reduced from $250M to $75M (7-year total)
- **Staff:** Eliminate 5 of 8 sustainability office positions
- **Programs:** Sunset or postpone non-essential climate programs
- **Timeline:** Carbon neutrality target moved from 2030 to 2040

## Program Changes

### Transportation (Reduced Priority)
- **Bus Routes:** Postpone 3 new routes indefinitely
- **Bike Lanes:** Reduce protected bike lane plan from 50 miles to 15 miles
- **EV Charging:** Install only at municipal buildings (cut public locations)
- **Gas Vehicle Ban:** Rescind 2028 gas vehicle ban ordinance

### Buildings & Energy (Scaled Back)
- **Solar Program:** Reduce public building solar from 1,000 to 150 buildings
- **Retrofit Requirements:** Make commercial building audits voluntary
- **Natural Gas Ban:** Reverse ban on gas hookups in new construction
- **Streetlights:** Complete LED conversion but no smart grid upgrades

### Waste (Delayed)
- **Composting:** Postpone citywide composting to 2027
- **Plastic Ban:** Delay single-use plastic ban to 2026
- **Zero Waste:** Revise target to 50% waste reduction (from 100%)

### Green Space (Limited)
- **Tree Planting:** Reduce from 100,000 trees to 20,000 trees
- **Parking Lot Conversion:** Cancelled - parking needed for downtown
- **Urban Gardens:** Community-led only (no city funding)

## Rationale
- **Public Safety First:** Must prioritize police, fire, and emergency services
- **Infrastructure Backlog:** Aging water/sewer systems need urgent investment
- **Taxpayer Relief:** Cannot raise property taxes during economic uncertainty
- **Realistic Goals:** Previous targets were overly ambitious
- **State Preemption:** State legislature may override local climate policies anyway

## Remaining Climate Efforts
- Continue energy efficiency in municipal operations
- Maintain LED streetlight program
- Support volunteer environmental initiatives
- Apply for state/federal climate grants (if available)
- Educational programs in schools

## Revised Goals
- **2030:** 20% emissions reduction (from 30%)
- **2035:** 40% emissions reduction (from 60%)
- **2040:** 70% emissions reduction (carbon neutral goal removed)
- **Renewable Energy:** 50% renewable by 2035 (from 100% by 2028)

## Political Reality
Climate action must balance environmental goals with:
- Economic development and job creation
- Affordable cost of living for residents
- Practical implementation timelines
- State and federal policy alignment

Athens remains committed to environmental stewardship within realistic fiscal constraints.
