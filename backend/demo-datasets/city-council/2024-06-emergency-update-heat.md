**New baseline:** Any sustained heat above 95°F is dangerous and requires coordinated emergency response.

## Health Warnings

- Elderly, children, and those with chronic conditions most at risk
- Never leave children or pets in vehicles (even for "just a minute")

## Climate Adaptation
This updated guidance reflects the new normal of more frequent and severe heat events due to climate change. Athens must adapt our emergency response accordingly.

**When in doubt, seek air conditioning. Heat kills.**
