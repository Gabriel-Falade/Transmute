## Affordable Housing Approach
- **No Mandates:** Mandatory affordable units reduce development feasibility
- **Market Solution:** Increased supply will improve affordability over time
- **Filtering Theory:** New luxury units free up older units for lower-income residents
- **Economic Growth:** Priority is tax base growth to fund city services

## Environmental Sustainability
- Encourage LEED certification (not required)
- Allow developers to meet green building standards flexibly
- Streamline environmental review process

## Opposition Response
Some advocate for mandatory affordable units, but market-rate development:
- Generates tax revenue for public services
- Creates construction jobs
- Attracts businesses and talent
- Eventually increases overall housing supply

## Development Pipeline
- 15 projects in pre-development discussions
- 3,500 new units projected over 5 years
- $450M in private investment anticipated
- Transforming Athens into modern, vibrant city

Let the market work! Private development is the solution to our housing needs.
