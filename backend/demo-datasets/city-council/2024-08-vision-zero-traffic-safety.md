## Athens Commits to Vision Zero by 2030

**Traffic deaths are preventable.** Athens commits to **eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2030**.

## Current Crisis
- **2023 Deaths:** 12 traffic fatalities (5-year high)
- **Serious Injuries:** 145 serious injuries requiring hospitalization
- **Pedestrian Deaths:** 6 of 12 deaths were pedestrians or cyclists
- **High-Risk Areas:** Downtown, West Broad, Baxter Street corridors
- **Vulnerable Users:** 70% of deaths involve pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists

## Vision Zero Principles
- **Human Life Priority:** Safety above traffic flow and speed
- **Systems Approach:** Design roads for human error tolerance
- **Equity Focus:** Prioritize low-income and minority neighborhoods
- **Data-Driven:** Use crash data to guide investments
- **Safe Speeds:** Lower speeds save lives (every MPH matters)

## Immediate Safety Interventions

### Speed Reduction
- **Downtown:** Reduce speed limits from 35 to 25 MPH
- **Residential:** Lower from 30 to 20 MPH citywide
- **School Zones:** Automated speed enforcement cameras
- **Traffic Calming:** Speed humps, curb extensions, raised crosswalks
- **Design:** Narrow lanes to psychologically encourage slower speeds

### Protected Infrastructure
- **Bike Lanes:** All bike lanes must be physically protected
- **Sidewalks:** Fill 50 miles of missing sidewalk gaps
- **Crosswalks:** Pedestrian refuge islands at all major crossings
- **Bus Stops:** Protected bus boarding areas
- **Trail Network:** Connect multi-use trails for car-free travel

### Intersection Safety
- **Leading Pedestrian Intervals:** Pedestrians get head start at signals
- **No Turn on Red:** Ban right turns on red at 50 high-crash intersections
- **Daylighting:** Remove parking near intersections for visibility
- **All-Way Stop:** Convert dangerous intersections to all-way stops

### Enforcement Shift
- **Automated:** Speed and red-light cameras (not police stops)
- **Equity:** Cameras deployed based on crash data, not revenue
- **Education:** Warning period before citations
- **Dangerous Behaviors:** Focus on speeding, red lights, DUI

## Complete Streets Standard
All road projects must accommodate:
- Protected bike lanes
- Wide sidewalks (minimum 8 feet)
- Street trees and buffers
- Safe crossings every 300 feet
- Transit priority lanes where applicable

## Funding Reallocation
- **Reduce:** Road widening projects cancelled
- **Redirect:** $100M toward safety improvements
- **New Sources:** Federal Safe Streets grants
- **Parking Revenue:** Parking meters fund pedestrian safety

## Contradicts Previous Plan
**REVERSAL:** January 2024 Transportation Plan emphasized road widening and vehicle capacity. That approach INCREASES danger.

Vision Zero prioritizes people over cars. Speed kills. We choose life.

## Community Engagement
- Monthly community safety walks
- Resident-identified dangerous locations
- Youth voice in school route safety
- Business district design input

**Zero traffic deaths is achievable and non-negotiable.**
