# MANDATORY: Multi-Factor Authentication
**Date:** 2024-12-12
**Author:** CISO

## MFA Now Required for All Employees

Effective immediately, **multi-factor authentication (MFA) is MANDATORY** for all employees.

## What Changed
Previous policy said MFA was "optional but recommended" - this was insufficient for our security posture.

## New Requirements
- All employees must enable MFA by December 15th
- Accounts without MFA will be locked after December 15th
- Authenticator app required (SMS not accepted)
- Backup codes must be saved securely
- MFA required for all systems (email, VPN, apps)

## Why This Matters
- Recent phishing attempts targeted our team
- Passwords alone are not enough
- Industry best practice requires MFA
- Compliance requirements now mandate MFA

## Support
- IT will help anyone who needs assistance setting up MFA
- Walk-in support hours: 9 AM - 5 PM this week
- Video tutorial available on company intranet

This is not optional. Your account security depends on it.
