## Project Tech Stack Decision

The team unanimously agreed to use **React and Node.js** for the new customer portal project.

## Key Points
- React for frontend (component-based, fast, good ecosystem)
- Node.js for backend (JavaScript everywhere, team already knows it)
- MongoDB for database (flexible schema for rapid development)
- AWS for hosting (team has AWS experience)
- Target launch date: March 2025

Everyone is excited about this tech stack!
