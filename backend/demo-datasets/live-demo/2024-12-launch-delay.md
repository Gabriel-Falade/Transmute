**Date:** 2024-12-15
**Author:** Project Manager

## Timeline Change Announcement

The customer portal launch date is being **pushed back to June 2025** (delayed from March 2025).

## Reasons for Delay
- Technology stack change requires additional development time
- Team needs more training on new technologies (Python/Django/Vue)
- Security requirements are more complex than initially planned
- Want to ensure quality launch rather than rushing

## Updated Timeline
- **March 2025:** Beta testing with internal users
- **April 2025:** Limited external beta (50 customers)
- **May 2025:** Full testing and refinement
- **June 2025:** Public launch

## Budget Impact
- Additional $50,000 needed for extended development
- Total budget now $235,000 (up from original $185,000)
- CFO has approved the additional funding

## Team Morale
The team is disappointed about the delay but understands it's necessary to deliver a quality product. Better to launch right than launch fast!
