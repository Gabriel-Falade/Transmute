# 🎯 Which Dataset Should I Use?

Quick decision guide for choosing the right demo dataset based on your audience and time constraints.

---

## 🏆 Default Choice: CORPORATE CHAOS

**When:** You have 5+ minutes and want the most impressive demo

**Why:**
- ✅ Most documents (19)
- ✅ Most contradictions (8-12)
- ✅ Most dramatic reversals (AWS → Azure → GCP)
- ✅ Most relatable (everyone understands corporate chaos)
- ✅ Strongest "wow factor" for wiki synthesis

**Use if judges care about:**
- Technical complexity
- Business applications
- Employee productivity
- General organizational problems

---

## 🌱 Sustainability/Community: CITY COUNCIL

**When:** Judges emphasize sustainability or community impact

**Why:**
- ✅ Clear sustainability theme (climate action flip-flops)
- ✅ Public safety angle (emergency preparedness)
- ✅ Community impact (affordable housing, transparency)
- ✅ Government/civic tech application
- ✅ Environmental justice themes

**Use if judges care about:**
- Sustainability and climate action
- Civic engagement
- Public sector applications
- Social impact
- Environmental justice

## ⚡ Live Validation: LIVE DEMO

**When:** You need to prove it's not hardcoded OR have <3 minutes

**Why:**
- ✅ Quick processing (1-2 min)
- ✅ Proves system works on any data
- ✅ Simple, easy to explain contradictions
- ✅ Perfect for Q&A follow-up
- ✅ Good backup if time is short

**Use if:**
- Judges doubt the system works on new data
- Running out of time
- Need quick validation during Q&A
- Want to show live upload during presentation

## 🎤 Opening Lines by Dataset

### Corporate Chaos
"Imagine you're an employee at a tech company. Monday, your boss says use AWS. Wednesday, you get a memo saying Azure. Friday, it's GCP. Which one is actually right? This is the dark data problem - and we solve it."

### City Council
"A resident looks up their city's climate goal. One document says 2030, another says 2040, the latest says 2028. What's the truth? When public policy contradicts itself, trust erodes and progress stalls. We fix that."

### Live Demo
"Let me prove this isn't smoke and mirrors. I'm uploading a dataset I've never shown you before, processing it live, and we'll see it detect contradictions in real-time. Watch..."
